2. why mongo://0.0.0.0:27017/Ecommerce")?

ide
design pattern


instead of remove(); we used deleteOne as it is depreciated (but deletMany also works need to check)
mail id in config: tempmailprog@gmail.com
			pass: proglab23
			
for all user
"oldPassword":"password",
"newPassword":"1234567d",
"confirmPassword":"1234567d"

there is problem in update profile 3.37.00
caursel not working 6.11.00
problem at 6.4.00

App .js Search instead search
use useNavigate instead of history in search.js (6.45.00)
use const { keyword } = useParams() instead of const keyword = match.params.keyword;
pagination done at 6.58.00
Product controller.js=>const resultPerPage = 8; we can use it to control the display of the product at page

SKIPPING THE SLIDER PART OF PRODUCT ==> 7.06.00 26 OCT


#Windows


Another one reason - maybe your port has been excluded by some reasons.

So, try open CMD (command line) under admin rights and run :

net stop winnat
net start winnat


From 7:00 till 7:10 we excluded filterProductscount 
since the query was already executed and error message was displayed in a loop

donot use import { config } from "dotenv" in loginSignup.js 7.55.41

We have downloaded express-fileupload at 8:2:00

for testing cloudinary:
	email: dogesh@gmail.com
	username: Dogesh
	pass: password123
	
	new user
	email: osama@gmail.com
	pass: passwordosama


Unable to register a user using UI


New admin is:-
abc@gmail.com
password:- 1234567d

In myprofile section Join On date is undefined because substr is depreciated -> profile.js

update profile is directing to login directly without loading update page 9:05:00


	At 9:11 when we edit profile it should be data?.user and not data?.success or hence it will fail
	File was userAction.js
        dispatch({type: UPDATE_PROFILE_SUCCESS, payload: data?.user});
