ide
design pattern


instead of remove(); we used deleteOne as it is depreciated (but deletMany also works need to check)
mail id in config: tempmailprog@gmail.com
			pass: proglab23
			
for all user
"oldPassword":"password",
"newPassword":"1234567d",
"confirmPassword":"1234567d"

there is problem in update profile 3.37.00
caursel not working 6.11.00
problem at 6.4.00

App .js Search instead search
use useNavigate instead of history in search.js (6.45.00)
use const { keyword } = useParams() instead of const keyword = match.params.keyword;
pagination done at 6.58.00
Product controller.js=>const resultPerPage = 8; we can use it to control the display of the product at page

net stop winnat
net start winnat
